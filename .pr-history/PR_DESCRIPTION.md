# Fix: ExpenseDetailView displays blank screen on first tap

## 🐛 Problem
ExpenseDetailView would display a blank screen when first tapped from the expense list, but would work correctly on subsequent taps. This created a poor user experience where users had to tap an expense multiple times to view its details.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by a **SwiftUI state update timing problem** in the sheet presentation logic:

1. User taps expense → `selectedExpense = expense` + `showingExpenseDetail = true` 
2. Sheet tries to present immediately → but `selectedExpense` update hasn't been processed yet
3. Sheet shows with `selectedExpense = nil` → `if let expense = selectedExpense` fails
4. Empty sheet is displayed → nothing shows

The problem was using `sheet(isPresented:)` with a separate boolean flag, which created a race condition between state updates.

## ✅ Solution
Replaced the problematic `sheet(isPresented:)` pattern with the proper SwiftUI `sheet(item:)` pattern:

### Key Changes:
1. **ExpenseListView**: Changed from `sheet(isPresented:)` to `sheet(item:)`
2. **Expense+Extensions**: Added `Identifiable` conformance to `Expense`
3. **Removed**: `showingExpenseDetail` boolean flag (no longer needed)
4. **Simplified**: Tap handler logic

### How `sheet(item:)` Fixes the Issue:
- **SwiftUI waits** for the item to be non-nil before presenting
- **No race condition** - sheet only shows when `selectedExpense` is actually set
- **Automatic dismissal** - when `selectedExpense` becomes nil, sheet dismisses
- **Cleaner code** - no need for separate boolean flags

## 🧪 Additional Improvements

### Enhanced Core Data Safety
- Added defensive programming to `formattedAmount()` and `formattedDate()` methods
- Added safety checks for deleted or invalid Core Data objects
- Improved error handling for Core Data property access

### Performance Optimizations
- Implemented debouncing in `ExpenseSortService` to reduce log spam
- Added intelligent filtering to prevent excessive sort operations
- Optimized Core Data context handling

### Developer Experience
- Added comprehensive SwiftUI previews for `ExpenseDetailView` debugging
- Added debug logging capabilities for troubleshooting
- Improved error messages and logging throughout the sort service

## 📁 Files Changed
- `ExpenseListView.swift` - Fixed sheet presentation logic
- `Expense+Extensions.swift` - Added `Identifiable` conformance
- `ExpenseDetailView.swift` - Enhanced safety and added previews
- `ExpenseSortService.swift` - Performance optimizations and debouncing
- `ExpenseDataService.swift` - Added UIKit import for memory warnings
- `ExpenseItem+CoreDataProperties.swift` - Added quantity property
- Core Data model - Updated ExpenseItem entity with quantity attribute

## 🧪 Testing
- ✅ ExpenseDetailView now displays correctly on first tap
- ✅ All SwiftUI previews work correctly
- ✅ Delete operations work without crashes
- ✅ Sort operations are more efficient with reduced logging
- ✅ Core Data context issues resolved

## 🎯 Impact
- **User Experience**: Eliminates frustrating blank screen issue
- **Performance**: Reduced unnecessary sort operations and logging
- **Stability**: Better Core Data error handling and safety checks
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner code with proper SwiftUI patterns

## 📝 Technical Notes
This fix demonstrates the importance of using the correct SwiftUI patterns for state management. The `sheet(item:)` modifier is specifically designed for presenting sheets with dynamic content and handles the timing issues that can occur with manual boolean flags.

The additional Core Data safety improvements ensure the app remains stable even when objects are in transitional states during operations like deletion or context merging.
