# Spec Task List Updates - Align with Current Implementation

## Overview

This PR updates the Receipt Scanner Expense Tracker specification task list to accurately reflect the current implementation status and correct misaligned task descriptions based on a thorough codebase analysis.

## Key Changes

### âœ… Completed Tasks Marked as Done

**Summary Infrastructure (Tasks 4.4, 4.5)**
- `SpendingAnalytics.swift` - Complete data models and calculations

### ðŸ”„ Task Corrections

**Task 4.6: Dashboard Integration (Previously Misaligned)**

- Identified missing reports view despite existing chart components
- ContentView currently shows "Reports Coming Soon" placeholder
- Task integrates existing chart infrastructure into user-facing reports interface

- Camera and image processing
- OCR and receipt data extraction
- Expense management features
- Summary data models and calculations
- Chart components (bar, pie, line charts)
- Theme management system
- Comprehensive test suite (34 test files)

### What's Next ðŸš€

- Reports view implementation (Task 5.2.1)
- Export functionality
- Budget tracking
- Authentication/security features
- Onboarding flow

## Quality Assurance

## Next Steps

After this PR is merged, development can continue with:
1. Task 4.6: Integrate real summary data into dashboard
2. Task 5.2.1: Build comprehensive reports view
3. Continue with remaining unimplemented features

This update ensures the spec accurately guides development and prevents confusion about what's already implemented vs. what needs to be built.
