# ExpenseSortService Crash Fixes

## Summary
Fixed multiple crash issues in the ExpenseSortService related to Core Data object validation and filtering logic.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Core Data Context Validation
**Problem**: The code was trying to access `isDeleted` property on `NSManagedObjectContext`, which doesn't exist.
**Fix**: Removed the invalid `context.isDeleted` checks and focused on validating the expense objects themselves.

### 2. Enhanced Object Filtering
**Problem**: The expenses.filter logic was crashing when Core Data objects became invalid during sorting operations.
**Fix**: Implemented comprehensive filtering in `performSort()` and `performMultiLevelSort()` methods:

- Added validation for deleted expense objects
- Added validation for managed object context availability
- Added accessibility tests by attempting to access basic properties
- Implemented graceful fallback when objects become inaccessible

### 3. Improved Error Handling
**Problem**: Insufficient error handling for Core Data object access during comparison operations.
**Fix**: Enhanced the comparison methods with:

- Better safety checks before property access
- Graceful fallback to object ID comparison when other comparisons fail
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### 4. Property Access Safety
**Problem**: Direct property access could fail if Core Data objects were in an invalid state.
**Fix**: Extracted property values into local variables before comparison to minimize the risk of accessing invalid objects.

## Key Changes Made

### In `performSort()` method:
- Enhanced filtering with comprehensive validity checks
- Added accessibility testing by attempting to access `objectID` and `date` properties
- Improved fallback logic with multiple levels of safety

### In `performMultiLevelSort()` method:
- Applied the same filtering logic as `performSort()`
- Enhanced error handling for multi-level comparisons

### In `compareExpenses()` method:
- Removed invalid `context.isDeleted` checks
- Extracted property values into local variables for safer access
- Simplified error handling by removing unnecessary do-catch blocks

### In `isEqual()` method:
- Applied the same property extraction pattern for consistency
- Removed unnecessary do-catch blocks

## Build Status
âœ… **Build Successful** - All compilation errors resolved, only minor warnings remain.

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test sorting with large datasets to verify performance
2. Test sorting when Core Data objects are being deleted concurrently
3. Test all sort options to ensure they work correctly with the new safety checks
4. Test multi-level sorting functionality

## Performance Impact
The additional safety checks have minimal performance impact as they primarily involve object validation that should be fast operations. The filtering is done once before sorting, not during each comparison.
