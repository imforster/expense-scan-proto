# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for refactoring the ExpenseList and ExpenseDetail views to address critical stability issues, improve performance, and create a more maintainable architecture. The current implementation suffers from CoreData lifecycle issues, complex state management, and poor error handling that result in frequent crashes and inconsistent behavior.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Stable Data Layer

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a reliable data layer that handles CoreData operations safely, so that the app doesn't crash when users interact with expense data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads expense data THEN the system SHALL use NSFetchedResultsController for automatic UI updates
2. WHEN CoreData operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully without crashing
3. WHEN multiple views access the same expense data THEN the system SHALL provide consistent data through a centralized service
4. WHEN heavy data operations are performed THEN the system SHALL execute them on background threads to avoid UI blocking
5. WHEN data changes occur THEN the system SHALL automatically update all relevant views without manual refresh

### Requirement 2: Robust ExpenseDetailView

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view expense details reliably, so that I can access my expense information without the app crashing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open an expense detail view THEN the system SHALL load the expense data safely without crashes
2. WHEN I edit an expense THEN the system SHALL handle the edit operation without causing view instability
3. WHEN I delete an expense THEN the system SHALL safely remove the expense and return to the list view
4. WHEN an expense is not found or deleted THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message instead of crashing
5. WHEN the expense data is loading THEN the system SHALL show a proper loading state
6. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with recovery options

### Requirement 3: Performant ExpenseListView

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter and sort my expenses smoothly, so that I can find the information I need without delays or crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I apply filters THEN the system SHALL update the list without blocking the UI
2. WHEN I change sort options THEN the system SHALL reorder expenses efficiently
3. WHEN I type in the search field THEN the system SHALL debounce the search to avoid excessive operations
4. WHEN the expense list is empty THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate empty state
5. WHEN filtering results in no matches THEN the system SHALL show a "no results" state with clear actions
6. WHEN I have many expenses THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth scrolling performance

### Requirement 4: Comprehensive Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when something goes wrong, so that I understand what happened and how to proceed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a CoreData operation fails THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message
2. WHEN network operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide retry options
3. WHEN data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery or guide the user to resolution
4. WHEN the app encounters an unexpected error THEN the system SHALL log the error for debugging while showing a generic user message
5. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide actionable next steps to the user

### Requirement 5: Maintainable Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean, testable architecture, so that I can easily maintain and extend the expense management features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing new features THEN the system SHALL follow single responsibility principle with clear separation of concerns
2. WHEN testing the application THEN each service SHALL be independently testable with proper mocking support
3. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL provide clear logging and error tracking
4. WHEN extending functionality THEN the system SHALL support new features without major architectural changes
5. WHEN reviewing code THEN the system SHALL have clear documentation and consistent patterns

### Requirement 6: Smooth Migration Process

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate to the new architecture safely, so that existing functionality continues to work during the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing new services THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing code
2. WHEN migrating components THEN the system SHALL allow gradual replacement without breaking existing functionality
3. WHEN testing the migration THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive test coverage for all migrated components
4. WHEN rolling back changes THEN the system SHALL support reverting to the previous implementation if issues arise
5. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL remove all deprecated code and update documentation

### Requirement 7: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the expense views to load quickly and respond smoothly, so that I can efficiently manage my expenses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading the expense list THEN the system SHALL display data within 500ms for typical datasets
2. WHEN applying filters THEN the system SHALL show results within 200ms
3. WHEN scrolling through expenses THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps performance
4. WHEN switching between views THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions without delays
5. WHEN the app starts THEN the system SHALL load the expense list progressively to show content quickly

### Requirement 8: Data Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want my expense data to be consistent across all views, so that I see accurate information everywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I edit an expense in one view THEN all other views SHALL reflect the changes immediately
2. WHEN I delete an expense THEN it SHALL be removed from all views and filters
3. WHEN I add a new expense THEN it SHALL appear in the appropriate filtered views
4. WHEN data synchronization occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity
5. WHEN concurrent operations happen THEN the system SHALL handle them safely without data corruption
