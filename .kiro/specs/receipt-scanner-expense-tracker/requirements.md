## Introduction

The Receipt Scanner Expense Tracker is a Swift-based iOS application designed to simplify expense tracking by allowing users to scan physical receipts using their device's camera. The app will extract relevant information from receipts (such as date, vendor, amount, and items), categorize expenses, and provide reporting features to help users manage their personal or business finances more efficiently.
