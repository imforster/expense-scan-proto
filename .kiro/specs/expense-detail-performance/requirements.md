# ExpenseDetailView Performance Optimization Requirements

## Introduction

The ExpenseDetailView is experiencing slow loading performance, impacting user experience when viewing expense details. This specification addresses the performance bottlenecks and provides solutions to optimize the view's loading and rendering speed.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Data Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the expense detail view to load quickly so that I can view expense information without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ExpenseDetailView is presented THEN it SHALL load within 200ms for expenses with standard data
2. WHEN accessing expense relationships (category, items, tags, receipt) THEN the system SHALL use prefetched data to avoid multiple database queries
3. WHEN displaying expense data THEN the system SHALL cache computed properties to avoid repeated calculations
4. WHEN the view appears THEN it SHALL minimize Core Data relationship traversals by batching data access

### Requirement 2: View Rendering Performance

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth scrolling and responsive interactions in the expense detail view so that the interface feels fluid.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scrolling through expense details THEN the view SHALL maintain 60fps performance
2. WHEN the view state changes THEN only affected components SHALL re-render
3. WHEN displaying lists of items or tags THEN the system SHALL use lazy loading for large collections
4. WHEN formatting currency and dates THEN the system SHALL use cached formatters to avoid repeated initialization

### Requirement 3: Memory Usage Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the expense detail view to use memory efficiently so that the app remains responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ExpenseDetailView is displayed THEN it SHALL use minimal memory footprint
2. WHEN accessing expense relationships THEN the system SHALL avoid loading unnecessary data into memory
3. WHEN the view is dismissed THEN it SHALL properly release all cached data and formatters
4. WHEN displaying receipt images THEN the system SHALL use lazy loading and appropriate image sizing

### Requirement 4: Data Access Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent performance regardless of the amount of data associated with an expense.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an expense has many items THEN the view SHALL load efficiently using pagination or lazy loading
2. WHEN an expense has many tags THEN the display SHALL not impact overall view performance
3. WHEN accessing expense properties THEN the system SHALL use computed properties with caching
4. WHEN the expense data changes THEN the view SHALL update efficiently without full re-rendering

### Requirement 5: Background Processing

**User Story:** As a user, I want data formatting and processing to not block the main UI thread.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN formatting complex data THEN the system SHALL perform heavy computations on background threads
2. WHEN loading receipt images THEN the system SHALL use asynchronous loading
3. WHEN calculating derived values THEN the system SHALL cache results to avoid repeated computation
4. WHEN the view updates THEN the main thread SHALL remain responsive for user interactions
